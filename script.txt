Hello, my name is Lisa. I'm here to help you write lisp code.

Let's make a function.

Great, but this variable needs a definition.

Done. Now don't forget the group.

See how fast that was?

Let me update the version number.

And make a change-log.

I can even write your commit messages for you.

Fantastic. We're gonna work great together.
