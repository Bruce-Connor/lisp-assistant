;;; Commentary:
;; 
;; Meet Lisa, your Lisp Assistant.
;;
;; `lisa-mode' is a minor-mode which defines a series of features to
;; aid in lisp development. It defines:
;;   1. a few useful functions,
;;   2. keybindings for these functions,
;;   3. buffer-local variables which contain package data (package name, version number, etc),
;;   4. yasnippet templates to aid in developing lisp code.
;; 
;; Most useful functions are: 
;;   1. `lisa-insert-change-log'
;;   2. `lisa-update-version-number'
;;   3. `lisa-find-or-define-function'
;;   4. `lisa-find-or-define-variable'
;; (see the `lisa-mode' function description for the others)
;; 
;; Most useful yasnippets are:
;; 
;;     (df ---> Expands to a full defun
;;     (dc ---> Expands to a full defcustom
;; (see the `lisa-mode' function description for the others)
;; 
;; These two snippets make use of some package variables (see the doc
;; of `lisa-define-package-variables' for more information). These
;; variables make the snippets super useful, and they are
;; automatically defined whenever you open an existing .el file or
;; create one from a template. If you create your file from scratch,
;; these won't be automatically defined, but you can use
;; `lisa-define-package-variables' to redefine them.

;;; Instructions:
;;
;; INSTALLATION
;;
;; The most basic installation process it to contact Lisa and then hire her:
;; 
;;     (require 'lisa)
;;     (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'lisa-mode)
;;
;; This will define several useful functions, the lisa-mode-map, and
;; the snippets.
;;
;; The best way to learn about all of these is to read the description
;; of lisa-mode (C-h f lisa-mode RET).
;;
;; To get the most out of Lisa, you need to give her a bit of data to
;; work with, so here's a sample configuration:
;;
;;     (require 'lisa)
;;     (setq lisa-helpful-keymap t)
;;     (setq lisa-github-username "BruceConnor")
;;     (setq lisa-name "Sir")
;;     (setq lisa-package-directories '("~/.emacs.d/packages/" "~/Git-Projects/"))
;;     (setq lisa-email "bruce.connor.am@gmail.com")
;;     (define-key lisa-mode-map (kbd "C-;") 'lisa-comment-sexp)
;;     (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'lisa-mode)

  "Meet Lisa, your Lisp Assistant.
lisa-mode defines a few functions, keybindings, buffer-local
variables, and yasnippet templates to aid in developing lisp
code.

The usual way to turn it on is:
    (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'lisa-mode)

Most useful functions are (see full keymap below for other functions):
\\[lisa-insert-change-log]  `lisa-insert-change-log'
\\[lisa-update-version-number]  `lisa-update-version-number'
\\[lisa-find-or-define-function]  `lisa-find-or-define-function'
\\[lisa-find-or-define-variable]  `lisa-find-or-define-variable'

Most useful yasnippets are:
   (df ---> Expands to a full defun
   (dc ---> Expands to a full defcustom
 (for the others, read after the keymap description below).

These two snippets make use of some package variables (see the doc
of `lisa-define-package-variables' for more information). These
variables make the snippets super useful, and they are
automatically defined whenever you open an existing .el file or
create one from a template. If you create your file from scratch,
these won't be automatically defined, but you can use
\\[lisa-define-package-variables] to redefine them.
